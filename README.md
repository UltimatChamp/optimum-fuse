<h3>An optimization and QoL modpack for Quilt, NeoForge, Fabric and Forge, based on <b><a href="https://modrinth.com/modpack/sop">Simply Optimized</a></b>!</h3>

This modpack is aimed to provide immense performance to Minecraft, with must-have features! It is based on newer technologies and improves your game's experience. This is not wholly a performance-focused modpack, but still outperforms all the leading-optimization solutions.
