### üõ†Ô∏èNotes/Changes

- I've added the **Crash Assistant** mod to the modpack. This will open a window listing the respective crash reports and logs. Additionally, it will also instruct you to report the crash on our **Discord server**. The mod is also useful in identifying which mod(s) were added/removed/updated by the user, on top of the modpack.
- What are your thoughts about the new **HUD** mod?
